        "\n",
        "AlexNet's structure bears a striking resemblance to LeNet, with a number of critical improvements, both for accuracy (dropout) and for ease of training (ReLU). What is equally striking is the amount of progress that has been made in terms of deep learning tooling. What was several months of work in 2012 can now be accomplished in a dozen lines of code using any modern framework.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reviewing the architecture, we see that AlexNet has an Achilles heel when it comes to efficiency: the last two hidden layers require matrices of size $6400 \\times 4096$ and $4096 \\times 4096$, respectively. This corresponds to 164 MB of memory and 81 MFLOPs of computation, both of which are a nontrivial outlay, especially on smaller devices, such as mobile phones. This is one of the reasons why AlexNet has been surpassed by much more effective architectures that we will cover in the following sections. Nonetheless, it is a key step from shallow to deep networks that are used nowadays. Note that even though the number of parameters exceeds by far the amount of training data in our experiments (the last two layers have more than 40 million parameters, trained on a datasets of 60 thousand images), there is hardly any overfitting: training and validation loss are virtually identical throughout training. This is due to the improved regularization, such as dropout, inherent in modern deep network designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although it seems that there are only a few more lines in AlexNet's implementation than in LeNet's, it took the academic community many years to embrace this conceptual change and take advantage of its excellent experimental results. This was also due to the lack of efficient computational tools. At the time neither DistBelief :cite:`Dean.Corrado.Monga.ea.2012` nor Caffe :cite:`Jia.Shelhamer.Donahue.ea.2014` existed, and Theano :cite:`Bergstra.Breuleux.Bastien.ea.2010` still lacked many distinguishing features. It was the availability of TensorFlow :cite:`Abadi.Barham.Chen.ea.2016` that dramatically changed the situation.\n",

        "## Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Following up on the discussion above, analyze the computational properties of AlexNet.\n",
        "    1. Compute the memory footprint for convolutions and fully connected layers, respectively. Which one dominates?\n",
        "    1. Calculate the computational cost for the convolutions and the fully connected layers.\n",
        "    1. How does the memory (read and write bandwidth, latency, size) affect computation? Is there any difference in its effects for training and inference?\n",
        "1. You are a chip designer and need to trade off computation and memory bandwidth. For example, a faster chip requires more power and possibly a larger chip area. More memory bandwidth requires more pins and control logic, thus also more area. How do you optimize?\n",
        "1. Why do engineers no longer report performance benchmarks on AlexNet?\n",
        "1. Try increasing the number of epochs when training AlexNet. Compared with LeNet, how do the results differ? Why?\n",
        "1. AlexNet may be too complex for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, in particular due to the low resolution of the initial images.\n",
        "    1. Try simplifying the model to make the training faster, while ensuring that the accuracy does not drop significantly.\n",
        "    1. Design a better model that works directly on $28 \\times 28$ images.\n",
        "1. Modify the batch size, and observe the changes in throughput (images/s), accuracy, and GPU memory.\n",
        "1. Apply dropout and ReLU to LeNet-5. Does it improve? Can you improve things further by preprocessing to take advantage of the invariances inherent in the images?\n",
        "1. Can you make AlexNet overfit? Which feature do you need to remove or change to break training?\n"

        "Memori memengaruhi perhitungan dalam dua cara: latensi (waktu untuk mengakses memori) dan bandwidth (jumlah data yang dapat ditransfer per satuan waktu). Selama pelatihan, baik read bandwidth maupun write bandwidth sangat penting karena perhitungan gradien melibatkan membaca input dan bobot, lalu memperbarui bobot. Pelatihan jauh lebih intensif dalam penggunaan memori dibandingkan inferensi. Selama inferensi, read bandwidth lebih kritis daripada write bandwidth, karena tidak ada gradien yang perlu disimpan. Hal ini mengurangi tekanan memori dibandingkan dengan pelatihan."

        "\n",
        "One might argue that VGG is the first truly modern convolutional neural network. While AlexNet introduced many of the components of what make deep learning effective at scale, it is VGG that arguably introduced key properties such as blocks of multiple convolutions and a preference for deep and narrow networks. It is also the first network that is actually an entire family of similarly parametrized models, giving the practitioner ample trade-off between complexity and speed. This is also the place where modern deep learning frameworks shine. It is no longer necessary to generate XML configuration files to specify a network but rather, to assemble said networks through simple Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "More recently ParNet :cite:`Goyal.Bochkovskiy.Deng.ea.2021` demonstrated that it is possible to achieve competitive performance using a much more shallow architecture through a large number of parallel computations. This is an exciting development and there is hope that it will influence architecture designs in the future. For the remainder of the chapter, though, we will follow the path of scientific progress over the past decade.\n",

        "    1. Compare the number of floating point operations used in the convolutional layers and in the fully connected layers.\n",
        "    1. How could you reduce the computational cost created by the fully connected layers?\n",
        "1. When displaying the dimensions associated with the various layers of the network, we only see the information associated with eight blocks (plus some auxiliary transforms), even though the network has 11 layers. Where did the remaining three layers go?\n",
        "1. Use Table 1 in the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` to construct other common models, such as VGG-16 or VGG-19.\n",
        "1. Upsampling the resolution in Fashion-MNIST eight-fold from $28 \\times 28$ to $224 \\times 224$ dimensions is very wasteful. Try modifying the network architecture and resolution conversion, e.g., to 56 or to 84 dimensions for its input instead. Can you do so without reducing the accuracy of the network? Consult the VGG paper :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` for ideas on adding more nonlinearities prior to downsampling.\n"

        "\n",
        "NiN has dramatically fewer parameters than AlexNet and VGG. This stems primarily from the fact that it needs no giant fully connected layers. Instead, it uses global average pooling to aggregate across all image locations after the last stage of the network body. This obviates the need for expensive (learned) reduction operations and replaces them by a simple average. What surprised researchers at the time was the fact that this averaging operation did not harm accuracy. Note that averaging across a low-resolution representation (with many channels) also adds to the amount of translation invariance that the network can handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choosing fewer convolutions with wide kernels and replacing them by $1 \\times 1$ convolutions aids the quest for fewer parameters further. It can cater for a significant amount of nonlinearity across channels within any given location. Both $1 \\times 1$ convolutions and global average pooling significantly influenced subsequent CNN designs.\n",

        "Recall that we do not even know why simpler\n",

        "\n",
        "The original paper proposing batch normalization :cite:`Ioffe.Szegedy.2015`, in addition to introducing a powerful and useful tool,\n",

        "by reducing *internal covariate shift*.\n",

        "i) This drift is very different from *covariate shift*,\n",
        "rendering the name a misnomer. If anything, it is closer to concept drift.\n",
        "ii) The explanation offers an under-specified intuition\n",
        "but leaves the question of *why precisely this technique works*\n",
        "an open question wanting for a rigorous explanation.\n",
        "Throughout this book, we aim to convey the intuitions that practitioners\n",
        "use to guide their development of deep neural networks.\n",
        "However, we believe that it is important\n",
        "to separate these guiding intuitions\n",
        "from established scientific fact.\n",

        "Following the success of batch normalization,\n",
        "its explanation in terms of *internal covariate shift*\n",
        "has repeatedly surfaced in debates in the technical literature\n",
        "and broader discourse about how to present machine learning research.\n",
        "In a memorable speech given while accepting a Test of Time Award\n",
        "at the 2017 NeurIPS conference,\n",
        "Ali Rahimi used *internal covariate shift*\n",
        "as a focal point in an argument likening\n",
        "the modern practice of deep learning to alchemy.\n",
        "Subsequently, the example was revisited in detail\n",
        "in a position paper outlining\n",
        "troubling trends in machine learning :cite:`Lipton.Steinhardt.2018`.\n",
        "Other authors\n",

        "claiming that batch normalization's success comes despite exhibiting behavior\n",
        "that is in some ways opposite to those claimed in the original paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We note that the *internal covariate shift*\n",

        "Batch normalization has proven an indispensable method,\n",
        "applied in nearly all deployed image classifiers,\n",
        "earning the paper that introduced the technique\n",
        "tens of thousands of citations. We conjecture, though, that the guiding principles\n",
        "of regularization through noise injection, acceleration through rescaling and lastly preprocessing\n",
        "may well lead to further inventions of layers and techniques in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "On a more practical note, there are a number of aspects worth remembering about batch normalization:\n",
        "\n",
        "* During model training, batch normalization continuously adjusts the intermediate output of\n",
        "  the network by utilizing the mean and standard deviation of the minibatch, so that the\n",
        "  values of the intermediate output in each layer throughout the neural network are more stable.\n",
        "* Batch normalization is slightly different for fully connected layers than for convolutional layers. In fact,\n",
        "  for convolutional layers, layer normalization can sometimes be used as an alternative.\n",
        "* Like a dropout layer, batch normalization layers have different behaviors\n",
        "  in training mode than in prediction mode.\n",
        "* Batch normalization is useful for regularization and improving convergence in optimization. By contrast,\n",
        "  the original motivation of reducing internal covariate shift seems not to be a valid explanation.\n",
        "* For more robust models that are less sensitive to input perturbations, consider removing batch normalization :cite:`wang2022removing`.\n",

        "\n",
        "Nested function classes are desirable since they allow us to obtain strictly *more powerful* rather than also subtly *different* function classes when adding capacity. One way of accomplishing this is by letting additional layers to simply pass through the input to the output. Residual connections allow for this. As a consequence, this changes the inductive bias from simple functions being of the form $f(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ to simple functions looking like $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The residual mapping can learn the identity function more easily, such as pushing parameters in the weight layer to zero. We can train an effective *deep* neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers. As a consequence, we can thus train much deeper networks. For instance, the original ResNet paper :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016` allowed for up to 152 layers. Another benefit of residual networks is that it allows us to add layers, initialized as the identity function, *during* the training process. After all, the default behavior of a layer is to let the data pass through unchanged. This can accelerate the training of very large networks in some cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior to residual connections,\n",
        "bypassing paths with gating units were introduced\n",
        "to effectively train highway networks with over 100 layers\n",
        ":cite:`srivastava2015highway`.\n",
        "Using identity functions as bypassing paths,\n",
        "ResNet performed remarkably well\n",
        "on multiple computer vision tasks.\n",
        "Residual connections had a major influence on the design of subsequent deep neural networks, of either convolutional or sequential nature.\n",
        "As we will introduce later,\n",
        "the Transformer architecture :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017`\n",
        "adopts residual connections (together with other design choices) and is pervasive\n",
        "in areas as diverse as\n",
        "language, vision, speech, and reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "ResNeXt is an example for how the design of convolutional neural networks has evolved over time: by being more frugal with computation and trading it off against the size of the activations (number of channels), it allows for faster and more accurate networks at lower cost. An alternative way of viewing grouped convolutions is to think of a block-diagonal matrix for the convolutional weights. Note that there are quite a few such \"tricks\" that lead to more efficient networks. For instance, ShiftNet :cite:`wu2018shift` mimicks the effects of a $3 \\times 3$ convolution, simply by adding shifted activations to the channels, offering increased function complexity, this time without any computational cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common feature of the designs we have discussed so far is that the network design is fairly manual, primarily relying on the ingenuity of the designer to find the \"right\" network hyperparameters. While clearly feasible, it is also very costly in terms of human time and there is no guarantee that the outcome is optimal in any sense. In :numref:`sec_cnn-design` we will discuss a number of strategies for obtaining high quality networks in a more automated fashion. In particular, we will review the notion of *network design spaces* that led to the RegNetX/Y models\n",

This remained the case from LeNet up until Transformers (:numref:`sec_transformer`) :cite:`Dosovitskiy.Beyer.Kolesnikov.ea.2021,touvron2021training` started surpassing CNNs in terms of accuracy. While much of the recent progress in terms of vision Transformers *can* be backported into CNNs :cite:`liu2022convnet`, it is only possible at a higher computational cost. Just as importantly, recent hardware optimizations (NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper) have only widened the gap in favor of Transformers.\n",

        "It is worth noting that Transformers have a significantly lower degree of inductive bias towards locality and translation invariance than CNNs. That learned structures prevailed is due, not least, to the availability of large image collections, such as LAION-400m and LAION-5B :cite:`schuhmann2022laion` with up to 5 billion images. Quite surprisingly, some of the more relevant work in this context even includes MLPs :cite:`tolstikhin2021mlp`.\n",
